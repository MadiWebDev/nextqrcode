Most QR codes that fail do not fail because the idea was wrong; they fail because a small typography mistake slipped through unnoticed. This guide collects the mistakes that show up most often, explains why each one breaks scanning, and shows how to fix it. Read it before you approve a design, and use it as a checklist when you review a proof. A mistake caught on one proof costs minutes; the same mistake caught after a full print run costs the run, the reprint, and the time you lose while the corrected version is made.

### Mistake one: crowding the code

Setting the call to action in tiny, pale, or decorative type that nobody can read at the real distance. If the instruction cannot be read, the code has to sell itself, and it cannot.

Fix it by pulling decoration, text, and color back outside the code panel, and by checking the quiet zone on all four sides of the proof. The code needs a calm island, and the fix is usually a matter of moving things outward rather than redesigning the whole piece.

### Mistake two: weakening the background or the margin

Letting text, a rule, or a decorative element crowd the quiet zone. Text inside the margin breaks the edge the scanner needs.

Fix it by restoring a solid, light background behind the code and a clean margin around it. If the surrounding design cannot give up that space, enlarge the panel or move the code to a calmer area. A code that fights its own background will keep failing, however often you reprint it.

### Mistake three: trusting the screen instead of the proof

Printing a long, broken, or mistyped address beside the code. A typed alternative that does not work is worse than no alternative at all.

Fix it by printing a proof at the final size on the real material and scanning it in the real light. Screens are backlit and flattering, and they hide ink spread, glare, and texture. The proof is the only honest version of the design, and it should be the version you approve.

### Putting this into practice

Take your current design and check it against the three mistakes above, one at a time, on a printed proof. Mark each problem you find, fix it, and proof again. Do not approve a design until it passes all three checks. Keep the checklist with the project file so the next designer does not repeat the same mistakes.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing. Treat every change as a reason to run a fresh proof, and treat any hesitation in a test scan as a signal to simplify rather than to hope the next phone will cope better.

### Quick checklist

- Keep dark modules on a light, even background with strong contrast.
- Leave a clear quiet zone on all four sides of the symbol.
- Keep the finder patterns solid, undisturbed, and easy to find.
- Check the code at the real size, on the real material, in the real light.
- Confirm the call to action names the payoff and the typed alternative works.
- Recheck the code after any change to the link, design, size, or placement.

Testing typography is not a formality; it is the step that separates a design that looks good from a code that actually works. This guide gives you a repeatable test you can run on any proof, with clear pass checks and fixes for the failures you are most likely to see. You do not need specialist equipment: a printed proof at the final size, two different phones, and the real lighting and viewing distance are enough. Run the test every time something changes, and keep a note of what passed so the next batch starts from a proven setup.

### What you need for a typography test

You need a proof printed at the final size on the real material, two different phones with different cameras, and access to the real placement with its real lighting. Bring a ruler or a simple module guide if you want to check the quiet zone precisely, and bring a pen to mark the proof with what you find. Stand at the real distance and read every word aloud without leaning in. Type the printed address into a phone and check it lands on the right page. If either step fails, fix the type.

### Step-by-step test

First, look at the proof without scanning. Check the code background is even, the quiet zone is clear on all four sides, and nothing touches the symbol. Second, stand at the real scanning distance and scan with the first phone, noting how quickly it locks on. Third, repeat with the second phone, then repeat again in the weakest light the code will face, and at a slight angle. Fourth, check the supporting text: read the call to action aloud from the real distance, and type any printed address into a phone to confirm it lands on the right page.

### How to judge pass or fail, and what to fix

A pass is a fast, first-try scan on both phones, at the real distance, in the real light, with no leaning, shading, or retrying. A scan that eventually works after several tries is a fail, because real users will give up before the third try. If the code fails, change one thing at a time: widen the margin, strengthen the contrast, simplify the decoration, or enlarge the code. Test again after each change, and keep the version that passes as your reference for the next batch.

### Putting this into practice

Run the test above on your next proof before you approve it, and write down the result: phones used, distance, lighting, and whether each scan passed on the first try. File the passing proof with the project so the next batch can be compared against it. A short written record turns a one-off test into a repeatable standard.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing.

QR borders decides whether a QR code feels like part of your design or like an afterthought stuck onto it, and it also decides whether the code scans. This guide sets out the working rules for borders, explains why each rule matters, and shows how to apply it on real materials. The rules are practical rather than theoretical: each one can be checked on a proof with your eyes and a phone, before you spend money on a print run. If you follow them, your code will look intentional and still read quickly in the place where it will actually be used.

### The core rules for borders

A border is the line or rule that sits around a QR code, separating it from the rest of the design. A good border gives the code a clean edge and helps the eye find it; a bad border merges with the modules, crowds the quiet zone, or adds visual noise that slows detection.

Keep the border outside the quiet zone, with a clear gap between the border and the symbol. The border is decoration around the code, not part of it. If the border touches the modules or narrows the margin, it stops framing the code and starts interfering with it.

### How borders affects scanning

Use a simple, even border with a calm color and a consistent weight. A thin, steady rule frames the code without competing with it. A thick, double, dashed, or high-contrast border draws the eye to the border itself rather than to the code inside it.

Keep the border shape simple and rectangular, matching the square shape of the symbol. A circular or irregular border around a square code leaves uneven gaps that can look like part of the pattern. If you want a badge shape, put the code on a plain panel inside the badge, not directly against the badge edge.

### Setting up borders before you print

Check the border at the real size and on the real material. A border that looks fine on screen can bleed, blur, or glare in print, and a border that is too close to the code on a small label can disappear into the modules.

Start with the plainest version that meets the brief, then add branding step by step, testing after each addition. If a step makes scanning slower, that step is the one to simplify. This gradual approach keeps the design honest: you can see exactly which choice helped and which choice hurt. Keep a copy of the last version that scanned instantly, so you can always fall back to a known-good design if a later variation fails.

### Putting this into practice

Pick one live design that uses borders and run it through this guide today. Print a proof at the final size, check the rules against it, and fix the first problem you find. Then scan the corrected proof with two phones in the real light. Keep the passing proof as a reference, and use it as the starting point for the next design so you are not solving the same problems twice.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing. Treat every change as a reason to run a fresh proof, and treat any hesitation in a test scan as a signal to simplify rather than to hope the next phone will cope better.

- Keep dark modules on a light, even background with strong contrast.
- Leave a clear quiet zone on all four sides of the symbol.

Seeing borders done well is faster than reading a list of rules, so this guide walks through examples that work in real places. Each example keeps the same discipline underneath the design: a clean code, a clear margin, strong contrast, and a message that tells people what they get. The examples cover different surfaces and distances, from a card held at arm length to a poster read from across a room. Use them as starting points, copy the structure, adapt the colors and words to your brand, and always test your own version before you print.

### Example one: a small, everyday use

A business card uses a thin, calm rule around a white panel that holds the code. The rule separates the code from the contact details without competing with it. A menu uses a simple border around the code panel.

The lesson is restraint. The code itself stays plain, the message is short, and the surrounding design does the branding. A reader who glances at the card understands what to do in a second, and a phone locks on without hunting.

### Example two: a larger, public use

A product label uses a light border to mark the code area on a busy pack, keeping the border well clear of the quiet zone. A poster uses a thin frame around the code square, with the call to action outside the frame.

The lesson is scale. A larger code earns a larger margin and a larger message, and the design respects that. The code is not squeezed into a leftover corner; it is given the space its viewing distance demands.

### Example three: a branded, busy surface

A library card uses a simple border around the code on the back of the card. The border helps staff find the code quickly, and the code still scans at the desk. A gift voucher uses a clean border that matches the voucher design.

The lesson is separation. The brand carries the pattern and the color, while the code carries a calm panel and a clean margin. The two jobs stay separate, and both succeed. Whenever a design tries to make the code itself carry the pattern, scanning suffers.

### Putting this into practice

Pick the example closest to your placement and rebuild it with your own brand and message. Keep the structure the same: a clean code, a clear margin, and a short message. Print it at the final size, scan it with two phones, and compare it with the example. If your version scans as quickly as the example, you have a safe design to build on.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing. Treat every change as a reason to run a fresh proof, and treat any hesitation in a test scan as a signal to simplify rather than to hope the next phone will cope better.

### Quick checklist

- Keep dark modules on a light, even background with strong contrast.
- Leave a clear quiet zone on all four sides of the symbol.

QR shadows decides whether a QR code feels like part of your design or like an afterthought stuck onto it, and it also decides whether the code scans. This guide sets out the working rules for shadows, explains why each rule matters, and shows how to apply it on real materials. The rules are practical rather than theoretical: each one can be checked on a proof with your eyes and a phone, before you spend money on a print run. If you follow them, your code will look intentional and still read quickly in the place where it will actually be used.

### The core rules for shadows

A shadow is the soft dark edge that a design tool adds behind a QR code to lift it off the page. Shadows can make a code look like a card floating over a background, but they also darken the quiet zone and the background the scanner relies on. Most codes scan better with no shadow at all.

Avoid shadows that fall inside the quiet zone or across the code background. A shadow that darkens part of the margin or the light modules breaks the even background the scanner needs. If you want depth, put the shadow outside the code panel, not under the code itself.

### How shadows affects scanning

If a shadow is essential to the design, keep it light, short, and even, and keep the code on a solid panel that the shadow does not touch. A soft, distant shadow behind a white panel can suggest depth without darkening the code. A hard, close shadow behind the code itself will not.

Check shadows in print, not only on screen. A shadow that looks subtle on a backlit screen can print darker and wider than expected, especially on absorbent stock. A printed proof shows the true shadow before the run.

### Setting up shadows before you print

Remember that shadows move with the light. A code that relies on a printed shadow can look different under shop lighting, daylight, and phone flash. A design that needs perfect lighting to scan is a design that will fail in real use.

Start with the plainest version that meets the brief, then add branding step by step, testing after each addition. If a step makes scanning slower, that step is the one to simplify. This gradual approach keeps the design honest: you can see exactly which choice helped and which choice hurt. Keep a copy of the last version that scanned instantly, so you can always fall back to a known-good design if a later variation fails.

### Putting this into practice

Pick one live design that uses shadows and run it through this guide today. Print a proof at the final size, check the rules against it, and fix the first problem you find. Then scan the corrected proof with two phones in the real light. Keep the passing proof as a reference, and use it as the starting point for the next design so you are not solving the same problems twice.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing. Treat every change as a reason to run a fresh proof, and treat any hesitation in a test scan as a signal to simplify rather than to hope the next phone will cope better.

### Quick checklist

- Keep dark modules on a light, even background with strong contrast.
- Leave a clear quiet zone on all four sides of the symbol.

Seeing shadows done well is faster than reading a list of rules, so this guide walks through examples that work in real places. Each example keeps the same discipline underneath the design: a clean code, a clear margin, strong contrast, and a message that tells people what they get. The examples cover different surfaces and distances, from a card held at arm length to a poster read from across a room. Use them as starting points, copy the structure, adapt the colors and words to your brand, and always test your own version before you print.

### Example one: a small, everyday use

A cafe menu prints the code on a flat white panel with no shadow, so the code reads in dim evening light. The menu still looks designed, because the panel and type carry the style. A business card keeps the code flat and clean.

The lesson is restraint. The code itself stays plain, the message is short, and the surrounding design does the branding. A reader who glances at the card understands what to do in a second, and a phone locks on without hunting.

### Example two: a larger, public use

A product pack puts the code on a flat white patch, with any shadow effects kept on the surrounding pack graphics, well away from the code. A poster puts the code on a flat panel, with the shadow behind the panel edge, not under the code.

The lesson is scale. A larger code earns a larger margin and a larger message, and the design respects that. The code is not squeezed into a leftover corner; it is given the space its viewing distance demands.

### Example three: a branded, busy surface

A conference badge prints the code flat, with no drop shadow, so it scans while attendees are moving. A shelf ticket keeps the code flat and matte, avoiding the glare that a glossy raised effect would add.

The lesson is separation. The brand carries the pattern and the color, while the code carries a calm panel and a clean margin. The two jobs stay separate, and both succeed. Whenever a design tries to make the code itself carry the pattern, scanning suffers.

### Putting this into practice

Pick the example closest to your placement and rebuild it with your own brand and message. Keep the structure the same: a clean code, a clear margin, and a short message. Print it at the final size, scan it with two phones, and compare it with the example. If your version scans as quickly as the example, you have a safe design to build on.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing.

Most QR codes that fail do not fail because the idea was wrong; they fail because a small shadows mistake slipped through unnoticed. This guide collects the mistakes that show up most often, explains why each one breaks scanning, and shows how to fix it. Read it before you approve a design, and use it as a checklist when you review a proof. A mistake caught on one proof costs minutes; the same mistake caught after a full print run costs the run, the reprint, and the time you lose while the corrected version is made.

### Mistake one: crowding the code

Adding a drop shadow that darkens the quiet zone or one side of the code. The shadow reads as an uneven background and slows detection.

Fix it by pulling decoration, text, and color back outside the code panel, and by checking the quiet zone on all four sides of the proof. The code needs a calm island, and the fix is usually a matter of moving things outward rather than redesigning the whole piece.

### Mistake two: weakening the background or the margin

Using a long or hard shadow that makes one edge of the code look darker than the other. The scanner sees an uneven symbol, not a stylish card.

Fix it by restoring a solid, light background behind the code and a clean margin around it. If the surrounding design cannot give up that space, enlarge the panel or move the code to a calmer area. A code that fights its own background will keep failing, however often you reprint it.

### Mistake three: trusting the screen instead of the proof

Approving a shadow from a screen preview without a printed proof. Print darkens shadows, and a subtle screen shadow can become a visible problem on paper.

Fix it by printing a proof at the final size on the real material and scanning it in the real light. Screens are backlit and flattering, and they hide ink spread, glare, and texture. The proof is the only honest version of the design, and it should be the version you approve.

### Putting this into practice

Take your current design and check it against the three mistakes above, one at a time, on a printed proof. Mark each problem you find, fix it, and proof again. Do not approve a design until it passes all three checks. Keep the checklist with the project file so the next designer does not repeat the same mistakes.

The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof.

Testing shadows is not a formality; it is the step that separates a design that looks good from a code that actually works. This guide gives you a repeatable test you can run on any proof, with clear pass checks and fixes for the failures you are most likely to see. You do not need specialist equipment: a printed proof at the final size, two different phones, and the real lighting and viewing distance are enough. Run the test every time something changes, and keep a note of what passed so the next batch starts from a proven setup.

### What you need for a shadows test

You need a proof printed at the final size on the real material, two different phones with different cameras, and access to the real placement with its real lighting. Bring a ruler or a simple module guide if you want to check the quiet zone precisely, and bring a pen to mark the proof with what you find. Print the design, hold it under the real light, and look for any darkening inside the quiet zone. Scan it from the real distance. If the shadow shows inside the margin, remove it or move it outside the panel.

### Step-by-step test

First, look at the proof without scanning. Check the code background is even, the quiet zone is clear on all four sides, and nothing touches the symbol. Second, stand at the real scanning distance and scan with the first phone, noting how quickly it locks on. Third, repeat with the second phone, then repeat again in the weakest light the code will face, and at a slight angle. Fourth, check the supporting text: read the call to action aloud from the real distance, and type any printed address into a phone to confirm it lands on the right page.

### How to judge pass or fail, and what to fix

A pass is a fast, first-try scan on both phones, at the real distance, in the real light, with no leaning, shading, or retrying. A scan that eventually works after several tries is a fail, because real users will give up before the third try. If the code fails, change one thing at a time: widen the margin, strengthen the contrast, simplify the decoration, or enlarge the code. Test again after each change, and keep the version that passes as your reference for the next batch.

### Putting this into practice

Run the test above on your next proof before you approve it, and write down the result: phones used, distance, lighting, and whether each scan passed on the first try. File the passing proof with the project so the next batch can be compared against it. A short written record turns a one-off test into a repeatable standard.

### Common mistakes to avoid

Even when the main rules are followed, small slips still creep in. The most common ones are letting decoration drift into the quiet zone, choosing colors that look distinct but share a brightness, and approving a design from a screen preview instead of a printed proof. Another frequent slip is changing one part of a working design, such as the link or the paper, without retesting the whole thing. Treat every change as a reason to run a fresh proof, and treat any hesitation in a test scan as a signal to simplify rather than to hope the next phone will cope better.
